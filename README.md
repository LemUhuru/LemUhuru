# Hi and Welcome, I'm Lem. 

A born and raised NYC dev from Queens, I recently moved to Miami, FL with my wife and 1 year old daughter to escape the cold winters but am now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, the doordash bill is now manageable and my wife is an excellent chef!! :p


As a developer, I love using machine learning to build practical applications that make my personal life more efficient. You can check out some of the powerful applications I've launched and use daily in my personal life.
