# Hi and Welcome, I'm Lem. 

A born and raised NYC dev from Queens, I recently moved to Miami, FL with my wife and 1 year old daughter to escape the cold winters but am now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, the doordash bill is now manageable and my wife is an excellent chef!! :p


As a developer, I love using machine learning to build practical applications that make my personal life more efficient. I've listed the ones I'm most proud of and that I personally use below. In addition, I write a weekly AI Newsletter at [esy.com/@ai][EsyEdu]
