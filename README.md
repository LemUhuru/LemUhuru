# Hi and Welcome, I'm Lem Uhuru. 

A born and raised NYC dev from Queens who recently moved to Miami, FL with his wife and 1 year old daughter to escape the cold winters but is now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, his doordash bill is now manageable and his wife is an excellent chef!! :p


As a developer, he loves using computer technology and machine learning to build practical applications that make his personal life more efficient. Check out some of the amazing apps he has launched and actually uses daily to write essays and manage personal finances, and track work performance.
