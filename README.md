# Hi and Welcome, I'm Lem. 

A born and raised NYC dev from Queens, I recently moved to Miami, FL with my wife and 1 year old daughter to escape the cold winters but am now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, the doordash bill is now manageable and my wife is an excellent chef!! :p


As a professional, I'm passionate about building practical applications that provide REAL value.
