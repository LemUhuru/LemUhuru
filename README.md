# Hi and Welcome, I'm Lem. 

A born and raised NYC dev from Queens, I recently moved to Miami, FL with my wife and 1 year old daughter to escape the cold winters but am now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, the doordash bill is now manageable and my wife is an excellent chef!! :p


As a developer, I build practical applications that add REAL value to my personal life. Recently, I've focused my research interest on the application of machine-learning for the analysis of my journals to help develop a profile of my writing style. I'm enjoying the process of discovering the various metrics that comprise of an individual's 'Writing Style' and how that knowledge can be used for better introspection and learning more about the 'self'.
